# Introduction to Neural Networks and Backpropagation

Welcome to this repository, where I am implementing the concepts of neural networks and backpropagation as demonstrated in Andrej Karpathy's video tutorial. This project is a hands-on exercise based on the video "The Spelled-Out Intro to Neural Networks and Backpropagation: Building Micrograd," where Karpathy explains and builds a simple neural network from scratch.
